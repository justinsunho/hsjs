# Introduction

Welcome to the webpage for Justin Kim's web development course! HS.js is meant to serve as a quick introduction to modern web development, going over the fundamentals for building websites.

## Why?

Modern web development moves at a lightning-quick, often overwhelming pace. Code styles, languages, and trends shift from one direction to the other on time scales of months, often in subtle ways that are hard for outsiders to pick up on.

This causes 2 major issues for studying web development:

1. Students find it too hard to know where, how, and what to start with. There simply is too much information out there.

2. High Schools, Colleges, and most education institutions can never focus on cutting-edge technology for fear of creating curriculum that will become out of date too quickly.

Although websites have seemingly been around for forever, the industry around building them is still new. Consensuses are hard to build, creating a wild-west environment.

This course will not cover everything one needs to know to become a Web Developer. That is an impossible task that thousands of professional web developers struggle with right now. However, this class will teach students how to adopt the traits that make for successful Web Developers: humilty, inquisitiveness, and the ability to learn on their own.

## What to Expect

Everyone learns at different paces, so this course will largely be following the student's pace. Students are expected to spend time learning on their own. This course is meant for guidance and coaching. Often times the most frustrating or overwhelming part about learning how to code is learning how to sift the wheat from the chaff. This course seeks to accelerate that process to encourage the fun side of coding.

## About

I'm a former self-taught web developer. In late 2017, I had graduated from UCLA with a degree in Applied Mathematics. I didn't know what jobs that would bring, so I decided to pursue programming. I was lucky enough to land an internship at a local company, Liferay, and learned everything I know from that experience. Eventually, I completed the internship, received a job offer, and began my professional journey.

I saw how others struggled in that internship despite previous experiences with Coding Bootcamps. Although effective at providing useful information, those bootcamps did not seem to prepare my fellow interns with the deep traits that create successful web developers.
